   qtclconsole & qpyconsole samples should be compiled and run
on every platform Qt (3.x & 4.x) can be compiled on.

qtclconsole:
============

   The only required library is the TCL library version 8.4 (an older
version could work as well but the .pro file needs to be modified).

   If the TCL library is not installed in a standard path, an environment
variable TCL_PATH should be set to point to the TCL installation path
(where there's its lib and include directories).

To compile and run the sample, just type:

qmake qtclconsole.pro
make
qtclconsole

  If you encounter link problems "undefined reference to `__ctype_b'", just compile tclmain.cpp
with -DFIX__CTYPE_

qpyconsole:
===========

   The only required library is the Python library version 2.4 (older
versions could work as well).

   Both environment variables: PYTHON_PATH & PYTHON_VERSION should bet
set in order to link with the python library. Example:

setenv PYTHON_PATH /usr
setenv PYTHON_VERSION 2.4

To compile and run the sample, just type:

qmake qpyconsole.pro
make
qpyconsole

  If you encounter link problems "undefined reference to `__ctype_b'", just compile pymain.cpp
with -DFIX__CTYPE_
