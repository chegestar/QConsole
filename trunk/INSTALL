qtclconsole & qpyconsole samples should be compiled and run
on every platform Qt 4.x can be compiled on.

qtclconsole:
============

   The only required library is the TCL library.

   If the TCL library is not installed in a standard path, an environment
variable TCL_PATH should be set to point to the TCL installation path
(where there's its lib and include directories).

Another environment variable TCL_VERSION should always be set, containing
the version of the TCL libary (example: 85)

To compile and run the sample, just type:

qmake qtclconsole.pro
make
qtclconsole

  If you encounter link problems "undefined reference to `__ctype_b'", just compile tclmain.cpp
with -DFIX__CTYPE_

qpyconsole:
===========

   The only required library is the Python library version 2.4 (older
versions could work as well).

   Both environment variables: PYTHON_PATH & PYTHON_VERSION should bet
set in order to link with the python library. Example:

setenv PYTHON_PATH /usr
setenv PYTHON_VERSION 2.4

To compile and run the sample, just type:

qmake qpyconsole.pro
make
qpyconsole

  If you encounter link problems "undefined reference to `__ctype_b'", just compile pymain.cpp
with -DFIX__CTYPE_
